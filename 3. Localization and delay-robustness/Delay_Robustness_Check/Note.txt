In total, a set of 66 event combinations is identified. If the original versions (i.e. not the observer events)
of an event combination are observed and controlled by the same local supervisor, the event combination
can be considered not delay-critical. This is the case, because communication delays do not occur within a
local supervisor. Therefore, the order in which these events occur can never change due to communication
delay. Moreover, as communication channels are considered as FIFO buffers, no other local supervisor
can observe this event combination in a changed order. The relevant event combinations are removed and
a set of 36 delay-critical event combinations remains.
