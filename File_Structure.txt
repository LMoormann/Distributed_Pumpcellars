This repository contains the following models of the distributed pump cellar system. Each folder contains a File_Structure.pdf file that explains the contents of that folder in more detail.

1. Plant and requirement models
Contains the discrete plant model and the requirements, the synthesized monolithic supervisor, the hybrid simulation model, and the Graphical User Interface model.

2. Multilevel synthesis
Contains the discrete plant model and the requirements, and the synthesized multilevel supervisor.

3. Localization and delay robustness
Contains the localized supervisors Loc1 and Loc2, and the models for the delay robustness check.

4. Controller checks
Contains the localized supervisors Loc1 and Loc2, and the models for the confluence check, the finite response check, and the nonblocking under control check.

5. Mutual exclusion
Contains the localized supervisors Loc1 and Loc2, and the implemented mutex locks.

6. Hardware in the loop
Contains the localized supervisors Loc1 and Loc2, the hardware mappings, and the generated PLC codes.
